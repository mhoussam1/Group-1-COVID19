## Machine Learning
Much of my time was spent connecting the dataset to the actual google colab spark file.
Setting up the data i used turned out to not have the qualifications to run a mechiene learning software.
My next goal is to connect the whole data set and then use the information to predict covid spikes and their peaks.
